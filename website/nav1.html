  <h1>The Beginning</h1>
  <p>The Twisted Lemon began with me Ana Bello, and a few of my friends.
    I started in our business in early 2021, the pandemic scared had started to mellow down and we were looking for a way to have a fresh start.
    I have always had a love for ceramics and so I thought why not share what ive learned with others. And so, the Twisted Lemon was born. </p>
