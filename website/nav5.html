  <h1>A little bit of history</h1>
  <p> Did You know that the origins of ceramics dates all the way back to Paleolithic times?
    That's right! In fact, the oldest known ceramic artifact is dated as early as 28,000 BCE, during the late Paleolithic period.
    It is a statue of a woman, you know as the Venus of Dolní Věstonice, from a small settlement near Brno, Czech Republic.
    Here hundreds of clay figurines representing Ice Age animals were also uncovered near the remains of a horseshoe-shaped kiln.
  </p>
<p>One of the first breakthroughs for ceramics was the invention of the wheel, in Ancient Egypt around 3,500 BCE.
  The wheel allowed the utilization of the wheel-forming technique to produce ceramic artifacts with beautiful symmetry.
  It had revolutionized the production of ceramic ware, and cut production time by more than half.</p>
